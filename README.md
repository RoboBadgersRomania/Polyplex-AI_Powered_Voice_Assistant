## Polyplex AI Powered Voice Assistant
 
This project is a Raspberry Pi based voice assistant that can hold conversations, use camera for multimodal interaction, search the web for updated information, and makes eye contact with the user while speaking. 

It uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo for natural language understanding and generation, and GPT 4 Turbo for its vision capabilities. 

A rudimentary version of the project was built during the 24 hours at The Bucharest Hackathon 2024 Edition, with improvements made later on for PoliFest and 'Sesiunea de Comunicări Ştiinţifice Studenţeşti 2024'.

## Features

- Voice activation using Porcupine
- Natural language conversation using OpenAI
- Respond in a changeable personality style
- Web search functionality using Tavily
- Voice response using Pygame
- Vision with OpenCV and GPT 4 Turbo
- Tracking with OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers
